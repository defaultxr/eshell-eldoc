#+TITLE: Eshell-Eldoc
#+DESCRIPTION: Eldoc support for Eshell.

Eshell-Eldoc is ~eldoc-mode~ support for ~eshell~.

Eshell-Eldoc first checks for elisp functions named by eshell's input and uses Emacs' built in eldoc functionality to display documentation if one is found.

If no elisp or eshell function with the name is found, the whatis(1) command is used to get a description of a shell command of the input text. Caching is built in to the whatis lookup, so slowdown should be minimal for repeatedly-typed inputs.

* Installation

Available via MELPA soon! Once it is, you should just be able to install it and immediately get its functionality on all future Eshell buffers.
